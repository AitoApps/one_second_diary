## About

This app was inspired by this [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day).

After installing many apps and not being satisfied with any of them, I decided to create my own, featuring the two aspects that I wanted the most: Minimalist and 100% Private. 

Therefore, this app that will never collect any kind of data and is completely free to use and without ads. 

The idea itself is pretty simple:
 - Open the app at the moment of your day that you would like to remember in the future
 - Tap the Record button and save the video
 - That's it, open the app the next day and repeat the process

Then, after a couple months or even years:
 - Tap the button to generate a compilation of all those videos, creating the movie of your life


Last but not least:
  ```
   It comes with Dark Mode set as default ðŸ˜‰
  ```


## Next Steps

If you have any suggestions or want to contribute, feel free to open a PR or contact me!

The future plans include:

- [ ] Login with Google account
- [ ] Integration with Google Drive for videos backup
- [ ] Select videos from gallery
- [ ] Edit any day by selecting it from calendar
- [ ] Record special days with up to 10 seconds duration
- [ ] Change date color and format in the videos
- [ ] Add a title to the video 
- [ ] Add a short description to the video as subtitles
- [ ] Generate custom movies with selected videos only
